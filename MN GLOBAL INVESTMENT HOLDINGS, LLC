Protocol Project: ChainMail – Bitcoin-Native Email

ChainMail is a Bitcoin-native email protocol that transforms messages into cryptographically verifiable, on-chain records. It eliminates reliance on centralized servers and integrates low-cost Bitcoin-based payments.

Project Summary

Phase 1 (six months) will:

Develop and pilot an Android client and protocol implementation for 100 Minnesota users

Demonstrate up to 90% reduction in remittance costs

Establish a new open-source communication standard anchored in Minnesota

Problem Statement

Current email and messaging systems:

Lack verifiable audit trails for communication

Delete messages irreversibly

Expose freelancers, gig workers, and immigrant communities to financial and contractual risk

Existing cryptocurrency tools address digital money scarcity but do not provide immutable, provable communication.

Solution & Innovation

ChainMail extends Bitcoin’s security model to communication, enabling messages to be:

Immutable and Verifiable – Each message is hashed and anchored on-chain using a lightweight proof-of-reply consensus

UTXO-Inbox Model – Messages are treated as UTXO balances, with read/unread status recorded as on-chain transactions

Integrated Payments – Bitcoin and Lightning Network integration enables micropayments directly within message threads

Non-Custodial and Privacy-Respecting – User keys remain local, with Tor integration for network-level privacy

Key innovations include:

Proof-of-Reply Consensus – Tamper-evident, verifiable message authorship using SHA-256 hashing

Lightning Integration – Peer-to-peer payments triggered from email subject lines

On-Device Cryptography – ECDSA keys with BIP-39 recovery phrases for secure, non-custodial storage

Phase 1 Objectives

Design and implement a ChainMail MVP compatible with Bitcoin Core and Lightning Network

Develop an Android application (“ChainMail – Mine Your Inbox”) for pilot testing

Onboard 100 Minnesota-based freelancers, immigrant community members, and content creators

Collect data to quantify cost reductions, payment reliability, and user satisfaction

Publish a technical whitepaper and pilot report to support Phase 2 scaling
