## Protocol Project: ChainMail – Bitcoin-Native Email

**ChainMail** is a Bitcoin-native email protocol that transforms messages into cryptographically verifiable, on-chain records. It eliminates reliance on centralized servers and integrates low-cost Bitcoin-based payments.

### Project Summary

Phase 1 (six months) will:
- Develop and pilot an Android client and protocol implementation for 100 Minnesota users.
- Demonstrate up to 90% reduction in remittance costs.
- Establish a new open-source communication standard anchored in Minnesota.

### Problem Statement

Current email and messaging systems:
- Lack verifiable audit trails for communication.
- Delete messages irreversibly.
- Expose freelancers, gig workers, and immigrant communities to financial and contractual risk.

Existing cryptocurrency tools address digital money scarcity but do not provide immutable, provable communication.

### Solution & Innovation

ChainMail extends Bitcoin’s security model to communication, enabling messages to be:
- **Immutable and Verifiable** – Each message is hashed and anchored on-chain using a lightweight proof-of-reply consensus.
- **UTXO-Inbox Model** – Messages are treated as UTXO balances, with read/unread status recorded as on-chain transactions.
- **Integrated Payments** – Bitcoin and Lightning Network integration enables micropayments directly within message threads.
- **Non-Custodial and Privacy-Respecting** – User keys remain local, with Tor integration for network-level privacy.

Key innovations include:
1. **Proof-of-Reply Consensus** – Tamper-evident, verifiable message authorship using SHA-256 hashing.
2. **Lightning Integration** – Peer-to-peer payments triggered from email subject lines.
3. **On-Device Cryptography** – ECDSA keys with BIP-39 recovery phrases for secure, non-custodial storage.


### Phase 1 Objectives

Over a six-month Phase 1, the project will:

1. Design and implement a ChainMail MVP compatible with Bitcoin Core and Lightning Network.
2. Develop an Android application (“ChainMail – Mine Your Inbox”) for pilot testing.
3. Onboard 100 Minnesota-based freelancers, immigrant community members, and content creators.
4. Collect data to quantify cost reductions, payment reliability, and user satisfaction.
5. Publish a technical whitepaper and pilot report to support Phase 2 scaling.


### Work Plan & Timeline (6 Months)

| Month | Activities |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Finalize technical specifications; set up repositories; generate ChainMail genesis identity. |
| 2–3 | Develop core protocol logic; implement Android client; conduct internal testnet trials. |
| 4 | Perform security review; implement end-to-end encryption; integrate spam filtering; optimize UX. |
| 5 | Launch Minnesota pilot with 100 users; collect structured feedback on usability and reliability. |
| 6 | Analyze pilot data; publish technical whitepaper; prepare Phase 2 funding proposal. |


### Target Population & Minnesota Impact

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
- Freelancers and gig workers who rely on email for contracts and payments and frequently face non-payment or disputes.
- Immigrant communities in Minnesota who currently pay high remittance fees or lack reliable, auditable records of financial and contractual commitments.
- Content creators and digital professionals seeking a tipping and payment infrastructure tied directly to their communications.

**Economic and Community Impact:**
- Up to 90% reduction in remittance and payment-related fees compared to traditional systems.
- Creation of new technical roles in Minnesota, including ChainMail protocol developers, support staff, and network operators.
- Establishing Minnesota as the origin of a novel open-source Bitcoin communication protocol, anchoring intellectual property, expertise, and early adopters in the state’s innovation ecosystem.
